# Facial Recognition Python Mini Project

This Python mini project demonstrates facial recognition using various Python libraries such as `face_recognition`, `OpenCV`, and `numpy`. The project enables real-time detection and recognition of faces through a webcam feed, allowing for attendance tracking and other applications.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using the webcam feed.
- **Face Recognition**: Recognizes known faces based on pre-loaded images.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Records the attendance of recognized individuals in a CSV file.
- **User Interaction**: Simple interaction via keyboard input (pressing 'q' to exit).
- **Real-time Display**: Utilizes OpenCV for displaying real-time video with detected faces and attendance information.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- `face_recognition` library
- `numpy` library

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
pip install numpy
```

# Usage
- Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
- Ensure that your webcam is connected and functional.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run the Python script `script.py`.
